# conky-config
Merutochan's conky configuration files

## Instructions
If you haven't installed conky already, get it with apt-get:
```bash
sudo apt-get install conky
```
Download the configurations in this folder and put them inside the ```$HOME/.config/conky/``` folder.

You may need additional scripts from my [TSC repository](https://github.com/Merutochan/TSC) to make the whole thing work.
